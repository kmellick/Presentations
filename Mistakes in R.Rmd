R is My First Programming Language
---
- I have made and still make lots of mistakes.
- Some of them are funny.
- Some, not so funny and very frustrating

But, look, I am doing this entire presentation in R Markdown
---
- [**http://rpubs.com/kmellickson/132883**](http://rpubs.com/kmellickson/132883)
- This means anyone can do this.
- I promise you will be happy you spent the time learning.

Here is one reason that my time learning R was worth it
---
##I am a lead on a Community Air Toxics grant
##We get our data bit by bit every month
##We want to look at it as we get it.

In order to look at our data, we need to do the following data processing
---
- Collapse redundant values with multiple qualifiers
- Calculate sampling rates to calibrate passive samples
- Convert passive mass to air concentrations
- Sum gas+particle results
- Add a censored/non-censored data column
- Format dates
- Merge site information
- Align passive sampling dates to first of the month

I wrote a script that does all of this.
---
- pulls a dataframe from the database, processes it as above, and saves a csv

- This means
  - I can update our data for each submittal and it takes seconds
  - All of the processing steps are documented so I don't need to re-learn what I did in an Excel spreadsheet.

But, let's get to the hilarious mistakes I have made along the way
---


Filtering and selecting from dataframes
---
- Selecting without a "$"
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, warning=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
data <- read.csv("X:/Programs/Air_Quality_Programs/Air Focus Areas/EPA Community Scale Monitoring of PAHs Project/Data Analysis/Data Processing/allPAHconcentrations.csv")
names(data)
data_MilleLacs <- data[MPCA_Site_ID == "3051", ]

#> data_MilleLacs <- data[MPCA_Site_ID == "3051", ]
#Error in match(x, table, nomatch = 0L) : object 'MPCA_Site_ID' not found
```
- The code above is looking for a character 3051 in a data frame that doesn't exist
- You want code that looks for that character within a vector

Below, I subset by the Site ID for Mille Lacs, MN
---
```{r, echo=TRUE}
data <- read.csv("X:/Programs/Air_Quality_Programs/Air Focus Areas/EPA Community Scale Monitoring of PAHs Project/Data Analysis/Data Processing/allPAHconcentrations.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
data_MilleLacs <- data[data$MPCA_Site_ID == "3051", ]
head(data_MilleLacs, n=3)
```

When subsetting on multiple values, use `%in%` not `==`
---
- The code below is testing whether the Year equals a list
- It is not answering the question is this year in this vector
```{r, echo=TRUE}
data <- read.csv("X:/Programs/Air_Quality_Programs/Air Focus Areas/EPA Community Scale Monitoring of PAHs Project/Data Analysis/Data Processing/allPAHconcentrations.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

data_year <- data[data$Year == c(2012, 2013, 2014), ]
head(data_year, n=3)
```

In the code below I use `%in%`
---
- The code below is correctly testing whether each year in the list is in the vector Year

```{r, echo=TRUE}
data <- read.csv("X:/Programs/Air_Quality_Programs/Air Focus Areas/EPA Community Scale Monitoring of PAHs Project/Data Analysis/Data Processing/allPAHconcentrations.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

data_year <- data[data$Year %in% c(2012, 2013, 2014), ]
head(data_year, n=3)
```

This is another of my favorites: Capitalization matters. 
---
- SAS is not case sensitive 
- R is Case Sensitive
- People who learn SAS first struggle with this
- Make your data names easy
- I am trying to make simpler names
  - all lower or uppercase
  - generic names
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, error=TRUE}
data_MilleLacs <- data[data$MPCA_Site_ID %in% "3051", ]
head(data_Millelacs, n=3L)

#Error in head(data_Millelacs, n = 3L) : object 'data_Millelacs' not found
```

If you mean no, or not this, remember the exclamation point!
---
- Below I am pulling all of the Results that are NA
- I am not doing what I intended, which is pull non-NULL values.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
data <- read.csv("X:/Programs/Air_Quality_Programs/Air Focus Areas/EPA Community Scale Monitoring of PAHs Project/Data Analysis/Data Processing/allPAHconcentrations.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
data_isnotNA <- data[is.na(data$Result), ]
head(data_isnotNA, n=3L)

```

Here is the correctely subset non-NA dataframe
---
```{r, echo=TRUE}
data_isnotNA <- data[!is.na(data$Result), ]
head(data_isnotNA, n=3)
```

When you use subset, remember 2 equal signs!
---
```{r, echo=TRUE}
data_north <- subset(data, location_if_collocated="north")
nrow(data)
nrow(data_north)
```

Here is the correct version with double equal signs
---
- Notice how my original dataframe and the subset dataframe do not have equal observations.
- This is something to remember to always check.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
data_north <- subset(data, location_if_collocated=="north")
nrow(data)
nrow(data_north)
```

Using read.csv and forgetting to include "stringsAsFactors=FALSE"
---
```{r, echo=TRUE}
data <- read.csv("X:/Programs/Air_Quality_Programs/Air Focus Areas/EPA Community Scale Monitoring of PAHs Project/Data Analysis/Data Processing/allPAHconcentrations.csv")
class(data$Season_StudyYear)
data[data$location_if_collocated == "north", "location_if_collocated"] <- "northeast"
head(data, n=3)

```

![stringFactors](stringFactors.png)


Here I pull in the dataframe with stringsAsFactors=FALSE
---
- Now, the appropriate transformation is completed
- If you use read_csv from the readr package, you do not have to assign class
 - read_csv does some guessing at classes and can result in unneccessary warnings
```{r, echo=TRUE}
data <- read.csv("X:/Programs/Air_Quality_Programs/Air Focus Areas/EPA Community Scale Monitoring of PAHs Project/Data Analysis/Data Processing/allPAHconcentrations.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
data[data$location_if_collocated == "north", "location_if_collocated"] <- "northeast"
head(data, n=3)
```
- str(dataframe) is a great way to check if your data have been pulled correctly

Making a chart for each parameter
---
-If you open a pdf device, and then run a plot function by parameter, A pdf document is created with each parameter on a separate page.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

closest<-read.csv("M:/KME Files/Model Monitor/2008 - Update_112014/Statistics/Data Tables and Processing/Measurements MNRiskS Results Closest Receptors.csv",header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=F)
closest=na.omit(closest)

pdf("Single Pollutant Modeled vs. Observed Plots_Closest Receptors.pdf")

splitspolls = function(x) {
  closest= subset(closest, substance==x)
  plot(closest$obs, closest$mod, type="p", xlab="observed ug/m3", ylab="modeled ug/m3", main = x)
  abline(0,1)
        }
lapply(levels(as.factor(closest$substance)), function(x) splitspolls(x))

dev.off()
```

The first time I did this, I opened the pdf device inside the function like this
---


```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
closest<-read.csv("M:/KME Files/Model Monitor/2008 - Update_112014/Statistics/Data Tables and Processing/Measurements MNRiskS Results Closest Receptors.csv",header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=F)
closest=na.omit(closest)

splitspolls = function(x) {
  pdf("Single Pollutant Modeled vs. Observed Plots_Closest Receptors.pdf")
  closest= subset(closest, substance==x)
  plot(closest$obs, closest$mod, type="p", xlab="observed ug/m3", ylab="modeled ug/m3", main = x)
  abline(0,1)
        }
lapply(levels(as.factor(closest$substance)), function(x) splitspolls(x))

dev.off()
```
- This opens as many pdf devices as there parameters
- So you must close many graphic devices

Avoid opening graphic devices inside of functions or loops, unless you allow for it
---
-If you do open MANY graphic devices, remember this command.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
graphics.off()
```

Making charts for each parameter is useful
---
- Below I pull data, create groups of Sampler Types and Time Summaries
- The "for loop"" makes a chart for each of those combinations, and names them by combination as well.
```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(RODBC)
library(openair)
db="X:/Programs/Air_Quality_Programs/Air Focus Areas/EPA Community Scale Monitoring of PAHs Project/Data Analysis/Model Monitor Comparison/Statistics/MNRiskS Measured Data Processing 2008.accdb"
bigdb=odbcConnectAccess2007(db)
buffers=sqlFetch(bigdb, "Monitor and Model Data for 1km Buffers", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
buffers=data.frame(buffers)

Sampler_Types <- unique(buffers$Sampler_Type)
summaries <- unique(buffers$summary)

for(i in Sampler_Types) {
  for(j in summaries) {
 ##ScatterPlot All Data
tiff(paste(i, j, "scatterplotloglog.tiff"), width=10, height=7, units="in", pointsize=12, res=300, type=c("cairo"))
scatterPlot(filter(buffers, Sampler_Type == i, summary == j), x="obs", y="mod", method="scatter", group="substance", data.thresh=0,
            type="default", mod.line=TRUE, linear=TRUE, log.x=TRUE, log.y=TRUE, xlab = paste(i, "_", "observed"), ylab="average modeled", 
            main=paste(i, "Measured PAHs and ", j, " Modeled PAHs within a 1km Buffer"))
      dev.off()   
}
}
```

Did anyone notice what I missed in that script?
---
- In the script in the previous slide I opened a connection to a database
- Then I pulled a table from it
- I didn't close the connection
- This isn't necessary
  - It is good practice to protect your database from unintended changes
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
odbcClose(conn) # close the connection to the file
```

Naming Columns
---
- Avoid spaces and periods in column names
- Don't start column name with a number, or an equation
- If you save a column name of "Chromium Hexavalent" R puts a "." in the space
- Then when you call that column you have to remember to write "Chromium.Hexavalent"
- Avoid this by simplfying names or using underscores
  + Or when importing files add `check.names=FALSE`

Numbers pulled in with comma separation: ``100,000`
---
- To get around this one, you can pull in your table as follows:
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(utils)
alldata <- read.table("alldata.csv", dec=",", stringsAsFactors=F)

##OR YOU CAN gsub()

alldata <- read.csv("alldata.csv", stringsAsFactors=F)
alldata$numbers <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", alldata$numbers)
```

Asking Questions
---
- In learning R I have asked a lot of questions.
- In the beginning, I would send someone the following:
- Why doesn't this work?
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
alldata <- unique(alldata)
alldata=as.data.frame(alldata, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
names(alldata) <- str_replace_all(str_trim(names(alldata)), " ", "_")
alldata <- group_by(alldata, MDH_Lab_ID_Code, Sampler_Type, MPCA_Site_ID, Result, Units, CAS, Start_Run_Date, Study_Location, passive_active, Qstd_Volume, Primary_Occurence_Code, location_if_collocated, Year, Season, Flags_Text, Study_Year, MDL, Analyte) %>% summarise(Qualifier=paste(Qualifiers, collapse=","))
alldata$passive_active <- as.character(alldata$passive_active)
passives<- filter(alldata, passive_active %in% "passive") 
passivecalcs<- group_by(passives, CAS, Study_Location, Season) %>% summarise(passive_cal_mean=mean(Result, na.rm=T))
gasactives<- filter(alldata, Sampler_Type %in% "PAHs Air, HiVol XAD")
gasactives<- group_by(gasactives, CAS, Study_Location, Season) %>% summarise(gasactive_cal_mean=mean(Result, na.rm=T))
allconcentrations <- mutate(allconcentrations, Unified_Date = ifelse(Sampler_Type %in% "Passive", FirstoftheMonth, Start_Run_Date))
allconcentrations$FirstoftheMonth <- NULL
allconcentrations$Unified_Date <- as.POSIXct(strptime(allconcentrations$Unified_Date, format="%Y-%m-%d"), tz="GMT")
allconcentrations$Start_Run_Date <- as.POSIXct(strptime(allconcentrations$Start_Run_Date, format="%Y-%m-%d"), tz="GMT")
```

Well, that's not fair. Who knows what I meant?
---

Here is a list of things to do before asking R-related questions
---
  - Google it first
  - Sometimes I am so frustrated I Google something along the lines of, "How do I split a dataframe by a factor variable in R"...and most of the times I get an answer in Stackoverflow or another R help information source
    - Beware, stackoverflow answers can sometimes be very irritably written, do not let that make you give up on learning R
  - I find the R-bloggers articles very helpful. Sometimes there is an entire article written about my exact question
  - Try to narrow down the question to one or a few lines that aren't working
  - Finally, sometimes you just need to turn R Studio off and turn it back on again.

When asking a question send the following (Noone in the history of the world has ever done all of this)
---
- example data
- R version: `Sys.info()`
- Operating system (if you are asking outside of your agency or group)
- reproducible code
- troubleshooting that you have already done.

Things I am working on right now in R
---
- Making my scripts more generic to avoid capitalization errors and spelling mistakes.
- Doing more with less typing.
- Getting better at writing functions.
- Checking my progress along the way.
